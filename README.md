# CropYieldPrediction

Crop Yield Prediction is a data-driven project that helps farmers, agricultural researchers, and policymakers estimate the amount of crop production in a given region before harvesting. The project uses historical agricultural data, weather parameters (like rainfall, temperature, and humidity), soil conditions, and farming practices to predict the yield of different crops. By applying Machine Learning (ML) models, the system can provide accurate predictions that assist in decision-making for better resource management, reducing risks, and ensuring food security.
